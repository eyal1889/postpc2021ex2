ans. for q1:
if we want to add an X button, we have 2 main changes to perform 
(thanks for separating UI and logic). 
in logic :first, we should add a mult. signature to the interface named "SimpleCalculator", and then
we should implement it at "SimpleCalculator"
in UI: add a button 'X' in the xml file, find it in MainActivity and difine an "OnClick" operation.
